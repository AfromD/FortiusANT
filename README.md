# FortiusANT
FortiusANT enables a usb-connected Tacx trainer to communicate with TrainerRoad or Zwift through ANT.

FortiusANT is running on the computer where the trainer is connected and broadcasts the ANT+ signal, using a dongle, to another computer or tablet.
You might also run TrainerRoad or Zwift on the same computer and then two ANT+ dongles on the same computer are required.
