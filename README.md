# FortiusANT
FortiusANT enables a usb-connected Tacx trainer to communicate with TrainerRoad, Rouvy or Zwift through ANT.

FortiusANT is running on the computer (Windows, Linux or MacOS) where the trainer is connected and broadcasts the ANT+ signal, using a dongle, to another computer or tablet.
You might also run TrainerRoad or Zwift on the same computer and then two ANT+ dongles on the same computer are required.
